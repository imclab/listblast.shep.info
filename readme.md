# LISTBLAST
Send emails to the ITP Student List without subscribing

**Listblast** is a small web app for the residents to write and send emails to the Student List.

## Why make this?
We want a way to tell the students what we're doing and don't have access to the ITP-Announce list. Posting to the student list is the best way to reach the largest part of ITP aside from handing out fliers to everyone we see. **Listblast** lets us post to the list to announce a help session happening _right now_ or to tell everyone we just posted a blog post or released some other thing.

## Usage
Usage of **Listblast** is restricted to members of the [ITPresidents](http://github.com/itpresidents) Github organization.
